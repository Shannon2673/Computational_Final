This project will be using a neural network and a 2D lattice model to predict the saturation of a porous medium, based off of
initial conditions.

This repository was created for a final project for the class PHY325 Compuational Physics at Pacific University. 

The code in this repository is written in Python 3. A useful package to use this code is Anaconda, however other python
interpreters should be sufficient. 

This repository uses the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
